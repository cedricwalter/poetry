# A Soliloquy of Marc Antony

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever liv√®d in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd by the hands of war
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
Then Caesar's spirit, raging with revenge
With Ate from his side come hot from hell

So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people 
When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.
